## Welcome to the github page of team Champions!

Our team was assigned a recruitment assignment from Sentia that highlights the strenghts needed by a cloud systems consultant.

This page will explain in detail our choices, mindset and teamwork that made this project happen. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/git-sbudhram/Sentia-project-AWS/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
